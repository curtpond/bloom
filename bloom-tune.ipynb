      "\n",
      "3. Take regular breaks - Step away from your workspace for a few minutes at least once an hour. Use this time to get some fresh air or take a short walk if possible. This can help to clear your mind, reset your concentration levels and improve focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Practice good posture - Ensure that your workstation is ergonomically correct and that you are sitting with your back straight and your feet planted firmly on the floor. A good posture can help reduce strain on your body and help to keep your spine aligned.\n",

      "5. Get enough sleep - Make sure to create a consistent bedtime routine for yourself and stick to it. Lack of sleep can lead to reduced alertness and concentration levels\n"
